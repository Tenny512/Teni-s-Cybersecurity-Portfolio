                <h3>Botium Toys: Risk Assessment & Compliance Audit</h3>
                <p>Conducted a comprehensive cybersecurity risk assessment for Botium Toys, evaluating their security posture using the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. Identified key vulnerabilities in asset management, encryption, and access control. Recommended security enhancements, including the enforcement of least privilege, encryption of sensitive data, and the deployment of an Intrusion Detection System (IDS). Assessed compliance with PCI DSS and GDPR, providing a roadmap for aligning security practices with industry standards. Developed a risk mitigation strategy to reduce the organization’s exposure to cyber threats and improve overall resilience.</p>

                <h3>Mock Security Audit</h3>
                <p>Performed a detailed internal security audit for Botium Toys, focusing on compliance with PCI DSS and GDPR. Evaluated security policies, access controls, and encryption measures to determine gaps in compliance. Recommended the implementation of AES-256 encryption for data security, SIEM solutions for real-time threat detection, and robust password management policies. Developed an audit framework for continuous monitoring of security controls, ensuring long-term regulatory compliance and improved data protection.</p>

            <div class="project">
                <h3>DDoS Attack Analysis</h3>
                <p>Investigated a Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack exploiting an ICMP flood vulnerability. Used network forensics to analyze traffic patterns and identify anomalous spikes in inbound packets. Implemented rate-limiting rules, source IP filtering, and an IDS/IPS system to mitigate future attacks. Provided strategic recommendations to enhance the organization’s defensive capabilities, including improved firewall configurations and real-time traffic monitoring using a SIEM solution.</p>

            <div class="project">
                <h3>Security Risk Assessment</h3>
                <p>Conducted a security risk assessment to identify critical vulnerabilities in a social media organization’s network infrastructure. Key findings included weak authentication mechanisms, default admin credentials, and a lack of firewall traffic filtering. Recommended a multi-layered security approach, incorporating multi-factor authentication (MFA), role-based access control (RBAC), and routine firewall rule maintenance. Strengthened security posture by proposing the implementation of an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) and advanced endpoint protection measures.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="project">
                <h3>SYN Flood Attack Analysis</h3>
                <p>Analyzed a SYN flood attack using Wireshark to capture and interpret packet logs. Identified malicious traffic overwhelming the web server’s resources, leading to a denial-of-service condition. Implemented SYN cookies, rate-limiting mechanisms, and enhanced firewall filtering to mitigate attack vectors. Proposed long-term countermeasures, including deep packet inspection (DPI) and behavioral anomaly detection, to prevent future exploitation of TCP handshake vulnerabilities.</p>
